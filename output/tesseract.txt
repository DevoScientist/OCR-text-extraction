A SuperGrok

lam addicted to my phone. Every 10 minutes | pick up my phone and doom scroll endlessly. It is
destroying my productivity and putting me in a bad mental state. I'd like to use that time now to chat with
you and generate new content/business ideas, and also reflect on my current projects and goals. | want
to make this chat my distraction from doom scrolling, so that when | feel like doom scrolling | instead
have a productive conversation with you that leads to self reflection and more business/content ideas.
What would you like to know about me so you can provide me the maximum value possible?
